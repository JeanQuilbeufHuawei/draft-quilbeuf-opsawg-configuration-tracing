              External Trace ID for Configuration Tracing
              draft-ietf-netconf-configuration-tracing-00

Abstract

   Network equipment are often configured by a variety of network
   management systems (NMS), protocols, and teams.  If a network issue
   arises (e.g., because of a wrong configuration change), it is
   important to quickly identify the root cause and obtain the reason
   for pushing that modification.  Another potential network issue can
   stem from concurrent NMSes with overlapping intents, each having
   their own tasks to perform.  In such a case, it is important to map
   the respective modifications to its originating NMS.

   This document specifies a NETCONF mechanism to automatically map the
   configuration modifications to their source, up to a specific NMS
   change request.  Such a mechanism is required, in particular, for
   autonomous networks to trace the source of a particular configuration
   change that led to an anomaly detection.  This mechanism facilitates
   the troubleshooting, the post mortem analysis, and in the end the
   closed loop automation required for self-healing networks.  The
   specification also includes a YANG module that is meant to map a
   local configuration change to the corresponding trace id, up to the
   controller or even the orchestrator.

1.  Introduction

   Issues arising in the network, for instance violation of some SLAs,
   might be due to some configuration modification.  In the context of
   automated networks, the assurance system needs not only to identify
   and revert the problematic configuration modification, but also to
   make sure that it won't happen again and that the fix will not
   disrupt other services.  To cover the last two points, it is
   imperative to understand the cause of the problematic configuration
   change.  Indeed, the first point, making sure that the configuration
   modification will not be repeated, cannot be ensured if the cause for
   pushing the modification in the first place is not known.  Ensuring
   the second point, not disrupting other services, requires as well
   knowing if the configuration modification was pushed in order to
   support new services.  Therefore, we need to be able to trace a
   configuration modification on a device back to the reason that
   triggered that modification, for instance in a NMS, whether the
   controller or the orchestrator.

   This specification focuses only on configuration pushed via NETCONF
   [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The rationale for this choice is
   that NETCONF is better suited for normalization than other protocols
   (SNMP, CLI).  Another reason is that the notion of trace context,
   useful to track configuration modifications, has been ported to
   NETCONF in [I-D.rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension] and RESTCONF in
   [I-D.rogaglia-netconf-restconf-trace-ctx-headers].

   The same network element, or NETCONF [RFC6241] server, can be
   configured by different NMSs or NETCONF clients.  If an issue arises,
   one of the starting points for investigation is the configuration
   modification on the devices supporting the impacted service.  In the
   best case, there is a dedicated user for each client and the
   timestamp of the modification allows tracing the problematic
   modification to its cause.  In the worst case, everything is done by
   the same user and some more correlations must be done to trace the
   problematic modification to its source.

Internet-Draft     Configuration Tracing via trace-id       January 2024


   This document specifies a mechanism to automatically map the
   configuration modifications to their source, up to a specific NMS
   service request.  Practically, this mechanism annotates configuration
   changes on the configured element with sufficient information to
   unambiguously identify the corresponding transaction, if any, on the
   element that requested the configuration modification.  It reuses the
   concept of Trace Context [W3C-Trace-Context] applied to NETCONF as in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-transaction-id] The information needed to trace the
   configuration is stored in a new YANG module that maps a local
   configuration change to some additional metadata.  The additional
   metadata contains the trace ID, and, if the local change is not the
   beginning of the trace, the ID of the client that triggered the
   local-change.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms client and server from [RFC6241].

   This document uses the terms transaction and Transaction ID from
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-transaction-id].

   This document uses the term trace ID from [W3C-Trace-Context].

   Local Commit ID  Identifier of a local configuration change on a
      Network Equipment, Controller, Orchestrator or any other device or
      software handling configuration.  Such an identifier is usually
      present in devices that can show an history of the configuration
      changes, to identify one such configuration change.

3.  Use cases

   This document was written with autonomous networks in mind.  We
   assume that an existing monitoring or assurance system, such as
   described in [RFC9417], is able to detect and report network
   anomalies , e.g.  SLA violations, intent violations, network failure,
   or simply a customer issue.  Here are the use cases for the proposed
   YANG module.

3.1.  Configuration Mistakes

   Taking into account that many network anomalies are due to
   configuration mistakes, this mechanism allows to find out whether the
   offending configuration modification was triggered by a tracing-
   enabled client/NMS.  In such a case, we can map the offending
   configuration modification id on a server/NE to a local configuration
   modification id on the client/NMS.  Assuming that this mechanism (the
   YANG module) is implemented on the controller, we can recursively
   find, in the orchestrator, the latest (set of of) service request(s)
   that triggered the configuration modification.  Whether this/those
   service request(s) are actually the root cause needs to be
   investigated.  However, they are a good starting point for
   troubleshooting, post mortem analysis, and in the end the closed loop
   automation, which is absolutely required for for self-healing
   networks.

3.2.  Concurrent NMS Configuration

   Building on the previous use case is the situation where two NMS's,
   unaware of the each other, are configuring a common router, each
   believing that they are the only NMS for the common router.  So one
   configuration executed by the NMS1 is overwritten by the NMS2, which
   in turn is overwritten by NMS1, etc.

3.3.  Conflicting Intents

   Autonomous networks will be solved first by assuring intent per
   specific domain; for example data center, core, cloud, etc.  This
   last use case is a more specific "Concurrent NMS configuration" use
   case where assuring domain intent breaks the entire end to end
   service, even if the domain-specific controllers are aware of each
   other.

3.4.  Not a use case: Onboarding

   During onboarding, a newly added device is likely to receive a
   multiple configuration message, as it needs to be fully configured.
   Our use cases focus more on what happens after the initial
   configuration is done, i.e. when the "stable" configuration is
   modified.

4.  Relying on W3C Trace Context to Trace Configuration Modifications

4.1.  Existing configuration metadata on device

   This document assumes that NETCONF clients or servers (orchestrators,
   controllers, devices, ...) have some kind of mechanism to record the
   modifications done to the configuration.  For instance, devices
   typically have an history of configuration changes and this history
   associates a locally unique identifier to some metadata, such as the
   timestamp of the modification, the user doing the modification or the
   protocol used for the modification.  Such a locally unique identifier
   is a Local Commit ID, we assume that it exists on the platform.  This
   Local Commit ID is the link between the module presented in this
   draft and the device-specific way of storing configuration changes.

4.2.  Client ID

   This document assumes that each NETCONF client for which
   configuration must be traced (for instance orchestrator and
   controllers) has a unique client ID among the other NETCONF clients
   in the network.  Such an ID could be an IP address or a host name.
   The mechanism for providing and defining this client ID is out of
   scope of the current document.

4.3.  Instantiating the YANG module

   [I-D.rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension] defines a NETCONF
   extension providing the trace context from [W3C-Trace-Context].
   Using this mechanism, the NETCONF server captures the trace-id, when
   available, and maps it to a local commit ID, by populating the YANG
   module.

                            +---------------+
                            | Orchestrator  |

Internet-Draft     Configuration Tracing via trace-id       January 2024


   It is technically possible that several clients push configuration to
   the candidate configuration datastore and only one of them commits
   the changes to the running configuration datastore.  From the running
   configuration datastore perspective, which is the effective one,
   there is a single modification, but caused by several clients, which
   means that this modification should have several corresponding
   client-ids.  Although, this case is technically possible, it is a bad
   practice.  We won’t cover it in this document.  In other terms, we
   assume that a given configuration modification on a server is caused
   by a single client, and thus has a single corresponding client-id.

4.4.  Using the YANG module

   The YANG module defined below enables tracing a configuration change
   in a Network Equipment back to its origin, for instance a service
   request in an orchestrator.  To do so, the Anomaly Detection System
   (ADS) should have, for each client-id, access to some credentials
   enabling read access to the YANG module for configuration tracing on
   that client.  It should as well have access to the network equipment
   in which an issue is detected.

Internet-Draft     Configuration Tracing via trace-id       January 2024


   The steps for a software to trace a configuration modification in a
   Network Equipment back to a service request are illustrated in
   Figure 2.  They are detailed below.

   1.  The Anomaly Detection System (ADS) identifies the commit id that
       created an issue, for instance by looking for the last commit-id
       occurring before the issue was detected.  The ADS queries the NE
       for the trace id and client id associated to the commit-id.

   2.  The ADS receives the trace-id and the client-id.  In Figure 2,
       that step would receive the trace-id tr-1 and the id of the
       Controller as a result.  If there is no associated client-id, the
       change was not done by a client compatible with the present
       draft, and the investigation stops here.

   3.  The ADS queries the client identified by the client-id found at
       the previous step, looking for a match of the trace-id from the
       previous step.  In Figure 2, for that step, the software would
       look for the trace-id tr-1 stored in the Controller.

   4.  From that query, the ADS knows the local-commit-id on the client
       (Controller in our case).  Since the local-commit-id is
       associated to a client-id pointing to the Orchestrator, the ADS
       continues the investigation.

   5.  The ADS queries the Orchestrator, trying to find a match for the
       trace-id tr-1.

   6.  Finally, the ADS receives the commit-id from the Orchestrator
       that ultimately caused the issue in the NE.  Since there is no
       associated client-id, the investigation stops here.  The
       modification associated to the commit-id, for instance a service
       request, is now available for further manual or automated
       analysis, such as analyzing the root cause of the issue.

   Note that step 5 and 6 are actually a repetition of step 3 and 4.
   The general algorithm is to continue looking for a client until no
   more client-id can be found in the current element.

5.  YANG module

   We present in this section the YANG module for modelling the
   information about the configuration modifications.

5.1.  Overview

   The tree representation [RFC8340] of our YANG module is depicted in

                                YANG module

   The local-commit-id represents the local id of the configuration
   changes, which is device-specific.  It can be used to retrieve the
   local configuration changes that happened during that transaction.

   The trace-parent is present to identify the trace associated to the
   local-commit-id.  This trace-parent can be transmitted by a client or
   created by the current server.  In Section 4.4, the most important
   field in trace-parent is the trace-id.  We also included the other
   fields for trace-parent as defined in [W3C-Trace-Context] for the
   sake of completion.  In some cases, for instance direct configuration
   of the device, the device may choose to not include the trace-id.

   The presence of a client-id indicates that the trace-parent has been
   transmitted by that client.  If the trace is initiated by the current
   server, there is no associated client-id.

   Even if this document focuses only on NETCONF or RESTCONF, the use
   cases defined in Section 3 are not specific to NETCONF or RESTCONF
   and the mechanism described in this document could be adapted to
   other configuration mechanisms.  For instance, a configuration
   modification pushed via CLI can be identified via a label, which
   could contain the trace-parent.  As such cases are difficult to
   standardize, we won’t cover them in this document.

       "This module enables tracing of configuration changes in a
        network for the sake of automated correlation between
        configuration changes and the external request that triggered
        that change.

        The module stores the identifier of the trace, if any, that
        triggered the change in a device. If that trace-id was provided
        by a client, (i.e. not created locally by the server), the id
        of that client is stored as well to indicated which client
        triggered the configuration change.

   This document includes no request to IANA.

9.  Open Issues / TODO

   *  Indicate what to do with O-RAN apps, since each of them might be
      seen as a different client with a different client-id.  This is
      actually a requirement that the client-id should be granular
      enough to distinguish between different controllers colocated on
      the same device.  For instance, the IP address might not be a
      suitable client-id in that case.

   *  Define how to pass the client-id.  Current leads are the trace-
      state from [W3C-Trace-Context] and W3C Baggage
      (https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/).

   *  The model and usage presented here focuses of the problem of
      tracing a configuration change back to its sources.  As it relies
      on [W3C-Trace-Context], we could also use associated mechanisms
      for collecting and representing trace data such as OTLP.  For
      instance, we could define a YANG model matching the OTLP
      protobuffer definition (draft: https://github.com/rgaglian/ietf-
      netconf-trace-context-extension/blob/main/ietf-netconf-otlp-
      protocol.tree).  In that case the client-id could be a specific
      attribute of the spans list.
