           External Transaction ID for Configuration Tracing
             draft-quilbeuf-opsawg-configuration-tracing-00

Abstract

   Network equipments are often configured by a variety of network
   management systems (NMS), protocols and people.  Each NMS might have
   its own task to perform and these tasks can overlap, leading to two
   different NMS reverting each other modifications on the same network
   equipment.  Also, the configuration pushed by an NMS can be modified
   by an engineer or some protocol.  In turn, this can bring services
   down and de-synchronize NMSs from their managed network equipment.
   We propose a mechanism to map the configuration modifications their
   source, up to the service request in the case of NMSs.  Such a
   mechanism would facilitate the troubleshooting and post mortem
   analysis.  Also, in case of more automated systems, the system could
   automatically identify two conflicting service requests, find a
   solution to the conflict and close the loop by sending new
   instructions to the conflicting NMSs.  This document proposes a new
   YANG model to map a local configuration change to corresponding
   northbound and southbound transactions, if any.  In the context of
   NETCONF, with compatible NMS, the model would also contain a
   reference provided by the NMS itself, to map back to the service
   request.

2.  Introduction

   When several NMSs are used to configure the network, the same network
   element or NETCONF [RFC6241] server can be configured by different
   NMSs or NETCONF clients.  In that case, the configuration or services
   configured by the first client might be impacted by the configuration
   pushed by the second client.  That impact is not always easy to
   detect, especially if the first client is not aware of the
   modification done by the second client and thus is in a correct state
   internally, so no NMS would report an error.  If an issue arise, the
   starting point for investigation is likely to be the configuration
   modification on a given device.  In the best case, there is a
   dedicated user for each client and the timestamp of the modification
   allows finding the reason why the second client did the modification.
   In the worst case, everything is done by the same user and some more
   tricks must be done to identify the source of the second
   modification.

   Two NMSs requesting different configurations for the same NE are in
   conflict.  In order to enable automation, we need to be able to
   automatically detect such conflicts, analyze their cause and
   automatically arbitrate them at a higher level.  While arbitration is
   outside of the scope of this document, finding out why the two NMSs
   are in conflict and possibly finding conflicting service requests is
   a good use case for this document.  Our proposition is to annotate
   configuration changes on the configured element with sufficient
   information to unambiguously identify the corresponding transaction,
   if any, on the element that requested the configuration modification.

   In [I-D.lindblad-netconf-transaction-id], the concept of a NETCONF
   transaction ID is proposed, to match the same mechanism from RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The goal of this document is to speed up the re-
   synchronization process between a client and a server, by using a
   common transaction ID.  If the current transaction ID on the server

Internet-Draft       Configuration Tracing via tx-id         August 2022


   is the same as the transaction ID known by the client, then both are
   synchronized.  Otherwise, the client has to fetch again the
   configuration.  The transaction ID can be applied to the whole
   configuration or to so-called versioned nodes.  In the later case,
   only versioned nodes for which the transaction ID differs need to be
   updated.

   Our proposed solution is to store a mapping between the existing
   local commit id and the northbound and southbound transactions
   related to that local configuration change.  The mapping is read only
   and populated by the server at configuration time.

   If the server is configured by an enabled client, then the client
   must send a transaction-ID and its own ID.  The server stores both as
   northbound transaction ID and corresponding client ID.

   If the server has to configure some other servers in response to a
   local configuration change, then it generates a transaction ID, sends
   it along with its ID to the other servers, and saves it as a
   southbound transaction ID.

   The two cases above are not mutually exclusive.  A controller can be
   configured by an Orchestrator and configure network equipment in
   turn.  In that case, both the northbound transaction ID, shared with
   the orchestrator and the southbound transaction ID, shared with the
   network equipments, are stored.  They are both associated to the
   corresponding local configuration commit.

3.  YANG Module

   We present in this section the YANG module for modelling the
   information about the configuration modifications.

3.1.  Overview

   The tree representation [RFC8340] of our YANG module is depicted in
   Figure 1

   The local-commit-id represents the local id of the configuration
   changes.  It can be used to retrieve the local configuration changes
   that happened during that transaction.

   The northbound-transaction-id should be present when the server is
   configured by a client supporting the external transaction ID.  In
   that case, the northbound-client-id is mandatory.  The value of both
   fields are sent by the client whenever it sends the configuration
   that trigger the changes associated to the local-commit-id.

   The southbound-transaction-id should be present when the current
   configuration change leads to the configuration of other devices.  In
   that case, the southbound-transaction-id should be generated by the
   server (and unique among other southbound-transaction-id fields
   generated on this server), sent to the configured devices and saved
   in that field.

7.  Open Issues

      Do we restrict to NETCONF or generalize to any automated
      configuration framework?  For instance, should a NMS that would
      use CLI to configure be supported by this draft as well?

      Terminology: NMS?  Orchestrator?  Controller?  NETCONF if we
      retrict to NETCONF?

      Is there an existing YANG module for storing the configuration
      changes?

Appendix A.  Changes between revisions

   Initial version

Appendix B.  Tracing configuration changes

   The model above enables tracing a configuration change in a Network
   Equipment back to its origin, for instance a service request in an
   orchestrator.  To do so, the software doing the tracing should have
   for each NMS ID (as stored in northbound-client-id), access to some
   credentials enabling read access to the model.  It should as well
   have access to the network equipments in which an issue is detected.

   The first step is to identify the commit id that created an issue.
   This step is not defined here, we assume that the software is able to
   identify a commit id.

   The software can match the commit-id with the local-commit-id of our
   model.  If they are no results, or no associated northbound-
   transaction-id, the change was not done by NMS compatible with the
   present draft, and the investigation stops here.

   Otherwise, the software connects to the NMS identified by the
   northbound-client-id.  The software looks for the northbound-
   transaction-id from the previous step in the southbound-transaction-
   id of the NMS.

Internet-Draft       Configuration Tracing via tx-id         August 2022


   From that query, the software knows the local-commit-id on the NMS.
   If the local-commit-id is associated to a northbound-transaction-id,
   the software can iterate the previous step with the NMS identified by
   the northbound-client-id field.

   Finally, the local-commit-id points to the changes in topmost NMS
   that eventually triggered the problematic configuration in the
   network equipment.  These changes are now available for further
   manual or automated analysis.
